  "summary": "All listed requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-4) appear to be implemented: the Login page shows a full-width yellow/amber marquee banner with German discontinuation text, login controls are disabled, the app is forced to always render the discontinued LoginPage (preventing Shop/Admin access), and persisted auth is cleared on rehydrate to prevent bypass. Styling remains in a warm amber/orange palette with light/dark contrast handling.",
